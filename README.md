# Project2--Customer Segmentation with Machine Learning

The practice of dividing a companyâ€™s customers into groups of individuals that are similar in specific ways relevant to marketing such as age, gender, interests, and spending habits is nothing but Customer Segmentation.

Customer segmentation is basically identifying key differentiators that divide customers into groups that can be targeted. The main goal of segmenting customers is to decide how to relate to customers in each segment to maximize the value of each customer to the business.

Nowadays Companies want to know their customers better so that they can provide useful customers with some goodies and also attract customers to purchase or make some kind of business with the company. When Companies know about customers and segment it into groups, it becomes easy for companies to send customers special offers meant to encourage them to buy more products.

Customer segmentation also improves customer service and assists in customer loyalty and retention.

With the help of Customer segmentation, we can also save waste of money on marketing campaigns. As we will be knowing the customers we need to target.

# About Machine Learning Customer Segmentation Project

Earlier Customer segmentation was a challenging and time-consuming task. This is because for segmenting customers we need to perform hours of manual poring on different tables and querying the data in hopes of finding ways to group customers together. So to overcome this task we will use machine learning to segment customers.
